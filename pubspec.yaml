publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
      - assets/img/
      - assets/images/
      - assets/gird4/
      - assets/icons/
      - assets/icons/bottom_menu/
      - assets/icons/products/
      - assets/icons/signin/
      - assets/icons/favourites/
      - assets/images/products/
      - assets/images/checkout/
      - assets/images/checkout/cart/
      - assets/splash/
      - assets/thumbs/
      - assets/thumbs/dress/
      - assets/thumbs/products/
      - assets/thumbs/shirt/
      - assets/thumbs/category/
      - assets/i18n/
      - assets/profile/
      - assets/placeholder.png
      - assets/default.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  
   

  fonts:
    - family: Metropolis
